## Project Overview

We were tasked with developing a Scholarship Management System that allows users to:

- Register and log in (User authentication)
- View a list of available scholarships with filtering by category
- Apply for desired scholarships
- View user profiles and check application status

This project is structured into two main parts:
- `frontend/` – built with React
- `backend/` – built with Node.js/Express
